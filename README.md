# Bank-Loan-Approval-Prediction-System

Loan approval is a very important process for banking organizations. Banking Industry always needs a more accurate predictive modeling system for
many issues. Predicting credit defaulters is a difficult task for the banking industry. The system approved or rejects the loan applications. Recovery of loans is
a major contributing parameter in the financial statements of a bank. It is very difficult to predict the
possibility of payment of loan by the customer. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are very useful in
predicting outcomes for large amount of data. In this project three machine learning algorithms, Logistic
Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) are applied to predict the loan approval
of customers. The experimental results conclude that the accuracy of Decision Tree machine learning algorithm is better as compared to Logistic
Regression and Random Forest machine learning approaches.
